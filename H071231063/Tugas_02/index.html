            <h2>Hello, I'm Ice Bear</h2>
            <h1>I'm from We Bare Bears</h1>
            <p>Ice Bear is the tritagonist of the Cartoon Network series *We Bare Bears* and its movie. He is voiced by Demetri Martin as an adult. In *We Bare Bears*, he is voiced by Max Mitchell. Ice Bear is an anthropomorphic polar bear. Even though he is the youngest of the Bears, he is noticeably taller, slimmer, and stronger than his brothers.</p>

            <p>Ice Bear is often stoic and rarely speaks. When he does, he mostly speaks in third person, starting sentences with his name instead of "I," as shown in "The Audition." In "Yuri and the Bear," it's revealed that Ice Bear was raised by a Russian man named Yuri after his mother was allegedly killed by hunters. This is how he learned Russian, and since Yuri exclusively spoke in third person, it is likely how Ice Bear adopted this habit. </p>

            <p> He is multilingual, speaking Korean, French, Japanese (in "Losing Ice"), and Russian fluently. Ice Bear can also communicate with pigeons in the episode "Our Stuff." He is also a skilled chef, dancer, pianist, robotics engineer, and charades expert (revealed in "My Clique"). In "The Island," it is shown that Ice Bear learned to speak very late and initially used his charades skills to communicate.</p>
