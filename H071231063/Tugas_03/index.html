          We Bare Bears is an American animated series created by Daniel Chong for Cartoon Network. 
          The show follows three bear brothers, named Grizzly, Panda and Ice Bear, and their awkward attempts at integrating with the human world in the San Francisco Bay Area.
          The series was based on Chong's webcomic The Three Bare Bears, and the pilot episode made its world premiere at the KLIK! Amsterdam Animation Festival, where it won in the "Young Amsterdam Audience" category. 
          The show premiered on July 27, 2015, and ended on May 27, 2019, and ran for four seasons and 140 episodes.[1][2]
          A film adaptation, We Bare Bears: The Movie was released digitally on June 30, 2020,[3] and later aired on Cartoon Network on September 7, 2020; it served as a conclusion to the narrative of the series.
          [2] A spin-off prequel series titled We Baby Bears focuses on the Three Bears when they were cubs. 
          It was announced in May 2019 to be in development and premiered on January 1, 2022.[4][5]

          Ice Bear “Lil’ Bro” is the youngest of the trio, but is undoubtedly the strongest, cleverest, and the most mature of them. 
          He was able to rescue his older brothers from certain deaths without too much hassle and is quick to jump into action if he finds a threat arising. 
          Ice Bear cares for both of his brothers dearly, and tends to do most of the chores of the house, though he doesn't seem to mind this. 
          Despite his caring nature, he still takes days off to relax and unwind. He is the cook of the trio and his brothers almost always depend on him.
          The Bears attempt to integrate with human society, such as by purchasing food, making human companions, or trying to become famous on the Internet, although these attempts see the Bears struggle to do so due to the civilized nature of humans and their own animal instincts.
          [6] However, in the end, they figure out that they have each other for support.
          [7]The Bears often form a "bear stack", which they use to get around the city, and has become perhaps the most recognizable image from the show.
          [6] Occasionally, the Bears share adventures with their friends, such as child prodigy Chloe Park (Charlyne Yi), bigfoot Charlie (Jason Lee), the Bears' rival and internet sensation koala Nom Nom (Patton Oswalt), park ranger Tabes (Cameron Esposito), and produce saleswoman Lucy (Ellie Kemper).

          Some flashback episodes chronicle the adventures of the Bears as cubs trying to find a home.
          We Bare Bears follows three anthropomorphic adoptive brother Bears: Grizzly (Eric Edelstein), Panda (Bobby Moynihan), and Ice Bear (Demetri Martin).
          Grizzly "Grizz" Bear is the oldest brother of the Bears. 
          He is familiar with the forest area that the Bears live in. 
          He is the leader of the three and tries his best to do what's right for both the benefit of his family and himself. 
          However, he can sometimes get carried away. 
          Growing up without parents or guardians, much like his adoptive brothers, he grew up trying to be a model big brother, though he was not very good at it. 
          He is at the top of the stack to show the hierarchy between the brothers.
          Panda "Pan Pan" Bear is the middle brother and, as stated by Grizzly, is "the link that holds them all, together." 
          He seems to have more knowledge about things regarding technology and things from Asian culture. As the most sensitive bear of the trio, he is both quite anxious and, as Grizzly also described, "cute." 
          Even so, Panda does care about his brothers and will try to pitch in whenever and however he can. He also tries to draw anime. He is very often annoyed by Grizz.
